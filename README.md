Our project aims to provide a platform where willing students can find study partners, share course materials and thus help each other. Thanks to StudyB, students will be able to get together after confirming that they are Bilkent students through their bilkent emails. On the course pages, students will be able to share course materials such as course notes and questions and will be able to answer and help each other. Students who are looking for a study partner will be able to create study rooms and will be able to work together with the people who enrolled in these rooms, either face-to-face or in a virtual environment.
There will be a scoring system to encourage students' cooperation and prevent lurkers. After a 2-week trial period, members who do not participate in any way but benefit from the materials of other people on the platform will be removed from the platform. Also a score system is developed according to the amount of participation which will have scoreboards according to the wishes of the users. Among the members who want to show their participation amounts in the score table, the most participating member will appear on the scoreboard of course page as the master of that course.
In addition, according to the courses students have enrolled, system will have their exam schedules and information, and they will be notified when the exam dates are approaching.
